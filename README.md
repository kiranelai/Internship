# Internship
Cronjob.py gives the output onion_prices.csv.
The zip file contains all files i did in my local system.
I will add another folder which includes all files in my drive(collab files,csv files, saved models etc..).
The combined_dataset.csv is the dataset that i used to build time series model.
onion_model.h5 is the saved model.
